The model proposed by JPB&MM (Bouchaud, J. P., & MÃ©zard, M. (2000). Wealth condensation in a simple model of economy. Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 282(3-4), 536-545. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437100002053 ) in the variant proposed by JPB that includes taxes and the governement (Bouchaud, J. P. (2015). On growth-optimal tax rates and the issue of wealth inequalities. Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 2015(11), P11011. https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-5468/2015/11/P11011/pdf)
